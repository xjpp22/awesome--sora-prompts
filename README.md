Sora's official prompts demonstrate that the visual impression of prompts is crucial. Imagine you're a film director who also pens novels.
1. Incorporate motion + sensory experience + intricate details
2. Camera movements: Think of your prompt as the camera. It's up to you to direct its movement to capture the essence of the scene. Eventually, your prompt should paint a coherent and sensible picture.
3. Sensory experience: Sight, hearing, taste, smell, touch (you don't have to use all of these, pick what's appropriate for the scenario). Portraying the protagonist's sensory encounters can enhance the vividness of the video.
4. Detailing: Pay attention to the significant elements of what you're characterizing and emphasize the aspects that carry the most weight.
